# Synopsis: 
Campus Crew is a mobile app designed to enhance the social experience of university students by helping them connect in real-time on campus. 
The app uses location-based features to display nearby students who are available for meetups, making it easy for users to engage with others based on shared interests or proximity. 
By simulating real-life interactions, Campus Crew fosters spontaneous connections, helping students overcome isolation and make the most of their time 
between classes through meaningful social interactions.
